## TASK 

  <img src="/images/tekup/waywa/task.png" alt="Securinets" style="width: auto; height: auto; margin-right: 10%;" />

## Solve 
This zip file contains a password in order to crack it im going to use john the ripper, its already available in kali linux no need for installation 
first command is to get the hash from the zip

```bash
zip2john task.zip > taskhash.txt
```
Next step to use a wordlist to crack the password, you can find your wordlist in the folder /usr/share/wordlists 

```bash
john --wordlist=/home/alimsahli/Desktop/rockyou.txt hash.txt
```

after we extracting it with the password we can find two files a7a_is_safe.pdf secured with password and useme.txt contains this link :
```
https://github.com/alimsahli/Password-Generator/blob/main/wordlist.txt
```
this link contains a custom wordlist that we can use to crack the pdf.
First we need to download it
Then we need to get the pdf hash using
```bash
pdf2john a7a_is_safe.pdf > hashpdf.txt
```
now using the custom wordlist we can crack it 
```bash
john --wordlist=wordlist.txt hashpdf.txt
```
and the password is "StrongPassword"
After opening the pdf we can see the flag in the picture of the footballer Ben Hmida
